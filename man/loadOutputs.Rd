  designScenarios = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{baseDir}{The base directory for the runs, same as bycatchSetup.}

\item{runName}{The run name, same as bycatchSetup.}

\item{runDate}{The date when the model was run. Defaults to current date, but can be set to read in models previously run.}

\item{designScenarios}{Character vector of designScenario values from original run. NULL to read in no design-based results.}

\item{modelScenarios}{Character vector of modelScenario values from original run.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with the setupObj from the specified run, a list called designObjList which contains the design-based model inputs and outputs for each designScenario, modelObjList, which is the same for the models in modelScenarios, and a data frame called allYearEstimates which is the annual estimates across all design-based and model-based scenarios in a format suitable for ggplot.
}
\description{
Reads in all the R objects created during runs of the bycatchEstimator for further analysis
