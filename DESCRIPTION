Authors@R: c(
    person(given = "Elizabeth", family = "Babcock", email = "ebabcock@rsmas.miami.edu", role = c("aut", "cre")),
    person(given = "William", family = "Harford", email = "bill@natureanalytics.ca", role = c("ctb")))
Description: The code can estimate both total bycatch, calculated by expanding a sample, such as an observer database, to total effort from logbooks or landings records, and an annual index of abundance, calculated only from the observer data.
