# Bycatch Estimator

Generic Model-Based Bycatch Estimation Procedure

## Details

The code can estimate both total bycatch, calculated by expanding a
sample, such as an observer database, to total effort from logbooks or
landings records, and an annual index of abundance, calculated only from
the observer data.
