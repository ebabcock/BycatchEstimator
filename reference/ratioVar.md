# Calculate variance of ratio estimator, from data already summarized by strata

Variables are x=sum(obs Effort),X=sum(log Effort), n=observed sample
units. N=log sample units, Rhat=mean(obs Catch)/mean(obs Effort), sx2,
sy2, and sxy are the observed variance in effort and catch, and
covariance

## Usage

``` r
ratioVar(x, X, n, N, Rhat, sx2, sy2, sxy)
